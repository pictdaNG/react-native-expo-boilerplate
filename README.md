You'll find the Expo guide & docs [here](https://docs.expo.io).

* Run `cd react-native-expo-boilerplate.git` in your terminal
* Next run `yarn install`  or `npm install` in your terminal to install dependencies
* Run `yarn start` in your terminal to start the React Native packager - so that you can run/access the app
